This is an work-in-progress Anki addon for performing complex batch field editing like what [Advanced Copy Fields](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1898445115), [Batch Editing](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/291119185) and the default Anki's regex search and replace can do, but more and all at once.
