- `increase_repCount` (default "false"): overwrites a built-in function from Anki. This might be dangerous in the long run. Only enable this if you otherwise run into errors. This is only useful for old Anki versions (<2.1.20)
- `make_deck_options_available` (default "false"): To see deck options during review I prefer [deck and card info sidebar during review](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/673114053) or [Extended Card Stats During Review](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1008566916) because these work for all note types. With this add-on you would have to adjust all templates. By default this option is disabled because I'm afraid that Anki might not render/use all fields if you have too many fields, see https://github.com/dae/anki/blob/master/anki/template/template.py#L113

also see the description on ankiweb [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/744725736).
